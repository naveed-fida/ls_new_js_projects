Make the following changes to the Todo Delete exercise:

- When the user right clicks a todo item, a context menu appears
- context menu has three items
  - show details
  - edit todo
  - delete todo

- You don't need to add functionality for 'show details', and 'edit todo'

- When the user clicks 'delete todo' option, the confirm prompt appears
- The rest of the flow is identical to the todo delete exercise
