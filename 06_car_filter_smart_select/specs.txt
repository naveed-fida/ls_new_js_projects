### Problem with car filtering
The car filtering application that we developed in the previous exercise works fine but it has a small problem. When we select a car make from the filtering options, the model select options remain the same. Ideally when a user select a car manufacturer, they should only be able to choose from car models only by that manufacturer.

### required change
Make the necessary changes in the car filtering application so that when as soon as a car make is selected, the select options for model are restricted to the models we have in our collection for that manufacturer.
