A list of todos with a custom confirm prompt for deleting todos.

## Requirements
- Create a list of todos in the DOM from a javscript collection(array) of todos 
- Add a delete button for each todo
- When the delete button is clicked a prompt appears asking the user to confirm.

- The prompt:
  - is a custom, css based prompt
  - has a yes and a no button
  - if the user clicks the yes button, the prompt disappears and corresponding todo is
    deleted
  - if the user clicks the no button, the promp disappears and the todo is not deleted

You can start with a collection of your choice. Here's the collection used in our demo app:
