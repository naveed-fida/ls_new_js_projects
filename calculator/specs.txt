A standard calculator GUI application in JS

- The calculator should have a screen

- The calculator screen should have two parts:
  - A part where the current entered number is shown
  - A part where all current operations are shown

- The calculator should have functioning buttons for the following:
  - All digits
  - +, -, /, *, %, =, NEG, C, CE
  - The button NEG negates the current entered number or result on the screen
  - The button CE resets the whole calculator screen
  - The button C clear the current entered number and displays 0 in its place

- When a digit button is clicked, it's added to the current number screen
- When an operation button is clicked, the current number along with the operation
  is added to the operations part of the screen and the result screen shows the result of previous operations

- When the = button is clicked, the operations part of the screen is cleared and
  the result/current number part of the screen displays the result
