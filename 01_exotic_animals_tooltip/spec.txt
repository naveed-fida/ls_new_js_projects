A page that displays a grid of images of animals and shows a tooltip

- Choose any pets/animals of your choice
- Create markup so that for each animal there's an image and a caption that 
  describes the animal in the image.
- The caption should be hidden initially
- When the image is hovered over for more than two seconds, a tooltip appears that
  shows the caption.
- The caption should not appear if the cursor is removed from the image before
  the two seconds time delay.
